just acoustic materials, no acoustic construction here (i.e., structural sound insulation). 

# Acoustic Material Properties



## Absorption coefficient



## Acoustic impedance



## Transmission loss



# Experimental Measurement

There are various methods used to measure and characterize acoustic absorbers.

## Impedance tube method

To understand and model absorptive materials better, it is necessary to measure materials in a more controlled environment to allow direct comparison between theory and experiment (numerical experiment included). 

1. **single microphone method**



2. **two-microphone method**



3. 



## Oblique incidence of a acoustic material



## reverberation room method

For most practitioners, the only important measurement is that which gives the random incidence absorption coefficient that is needed for performance specifications in room design.
