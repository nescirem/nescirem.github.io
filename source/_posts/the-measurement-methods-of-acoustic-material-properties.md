# Acoustic Material Properties

With the in-depth study of acoustic materials and broad application of them, the importance of the characterising acoustic material properties has emerged and risen gradually. The absorption properties and acoustic insulation properties are most used evaluation indexes for acoustic materials. The absorption properties include absorption coefficient and acoustic impedance; the acoustic insulation properties usually evaluated by the transmission losses.

## Absorption coefficient



## Acoustic impedance



## Transmission loss



# Experimental Measurement

There are various methods used to measure and characterize acoustic absorbers.

## Normal incidence (impedance or standing wave tube)

To understand and model absorptive materials better, it is necessary to measure materials in a more controlled environment to allow direct comparison between theory and experiment (numerical experiment included). 

1. **standing wave method**



2. **transfer function method**



3. **least mean square method**



## Oblique incidence (semi-anechoic spaces)



## reverberation room

For most practitioners, the only important measurement is that which gives the random incidence absorption coefficient that is needed for performance specifications in room designing, vegetation belt setting, and so on.
